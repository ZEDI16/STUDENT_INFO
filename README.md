<h6>Welcome to our GitHub repository for a basic Java project designed for senior high school students!</h6>

## How it works.
> Firstly, download the repository file. Simply navigate to the repository where the file is located, click on the "code" button, and select "Download ZIP". if you're confused; [click here](https://youtu.be/1a1NDCN8Jog). Make sure to unzip a file; if you don't know how, [click here](https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File).

> Now open your IDE. If you don't have one, then I recommend [Visual studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/). but if you're limited to wifi, then I suggest downloading [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/) instead.

> After downloading Visual Studio Code, you can install it on your computer by running the installer file. Once the installation process is complete, you can open Visual Studio Code and start using it to write, debug, and test your code. 

> Open the Java file or folder in Visual Studio Code after downloading. To open a Java file, click on the "File" menu and select "Open Folder". Navigate to the location where you downloaded the Java file and select the folder that contains it. The Java file should now be visible in the file explorer pane on the left side of the editor. Click on the Java file to open it in the editor pane on the right side of the screen. You can now view and edit the code in the file, and use the various features of Visual Studio Code to work with it, such as debugging, testing, and formatting.

> You may need to install extensions or plugins that support the Java programming language in order to work with Java files in Visual Studio Code. [click here](https://www.java.com/en/) to download it.

> Lastly click on the "Run" menu, and select "Run Without Debugging" or press "Ctrl + F5" on Windows, or "Cmd + F5" on Mac.
